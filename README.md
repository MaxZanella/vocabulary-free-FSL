## Quick Overview

In many real-world applications, class names may be unavailable, ambiguous, or poorly defined ‚Äî yet we still want to adapt Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using only a few visual examples. As shown in the figure below, traditional few-shot learning methods rely heavily on known class names and handcrafted prompts, whereas **vocabulary-free few-shot learning** eliminates this dependency by leveraging only generic prompts (e.g., from ImageNet classes).

**We introduce _SiM_ (Similarity Mapping)** ‚Äî a simple yet powerful baseline for vocabulary-free few-shot learning with VLMs.

Unlike conventional approaches that rely on textual labels and manual prompt design, SiM bypasses vocabulary entirely: it learns a **linear mapping** between similarity scores (computed between input images and a fixed set of generic prompts) and target classes ‚Äî enabling classification without access to any class names.

### In short:
- üî§ **Vocabulary-free**: no class names or handcrafted prompts required.
- ‚ö° **Lightweight**: the mapping is learned in under one second.
- üîç **Interpretable**: learned weights reveal how target classes align with known concepts.
